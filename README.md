This application is a clone of Stack Overflow.
Users can login to ask a question that all other users can view, and provide answers to.

The Home page displays a list of questions, with a short preview to the text of the question, and the amount of answers submitted already.
When the user clicks on the title of the question, they are brought to a page with the full details of the question, including a list of all answers submitted.

This application uses Authentication, to ensure that the user is logged in in order to ask a question, or answer a previously submitted question.
